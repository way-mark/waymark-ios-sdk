# Objective-C Waymark SDK

Overview

This page contains the formal description of WaymarkSDK API: a list of classes and their public fields and methods which provide the following functionality:

automatically registering your device on the Waymark Platform;
automatically authorize on the Waymark Platform;
reacting to iBacon signal and receive information from server;
sending information about received push;
The following API can be used for building your own iOS apps using our Waymark library.

Usage

Initialize

To be able to use the library you: the first thing you need to do is to get your unique apiKey. To do that please contact Waymark support.

First of all you should defile WaymarkSDK object which conforms to protocol:

#import "WaymarkSDK.h"

@interface MyCustomViewController : ViewController <WaymarkSDKDelegate>
@property (strong, nonatomic) WaymarkSDK *waymark;
@end
Initialize WaymarkSDK object with your apiKey. Set delegate.

// kWMAPIKey - your apiKey
_waymark = [[WaymarkSDK alloc] initWithApiKey:kWMAPIKey];
_waymark.delegate = self;
Start/Stop SDK

To start and stop SDK you should call:

[_waymark start];
// or
[_waymark stop];
WMPush Class

@interface WMPush : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *title;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *text;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *type;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *targetting;
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *key;
@end
Delegate

To receive push information from server you should implement waymarkSDK: recievedPush: method of WaymarkSDKDelegate protocol.

- (void) waymarkSDK:(WaymarkSDK *)waymarkSDK recievedPush:(WMPush *)push{
// handle push
}
In your waymarkSDK:authentificationFailedWithError: method of WaymarkSDKDelegate protocol you can receive error if authorization unavaliable.

- (void) waymarkSDK:(WaymarkSDK *)waymarkSDK authentificationFailedWithError:(NSError *)error{
  NSLog(@"%@",error);
}
